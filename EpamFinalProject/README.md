# Final Project

### The Task: Cruise company

The company has several cruise shipDTOS. 

The shipDTO has its own passenger capacity, route, number of ports visited, start and end of the cruise, staff.

The client selects a cruise from the catalog, places an order for it, if there are free seats, uploads a scanned copy of documents and pays the full cost of the cruise, after the cruise company administrator confirmed the possibility of the tour.
Implement the ability to choose a cruise by date and duration.

The cruise company administrator manages cruise shipDTO records and customer orders, changing their status to "paid".
The application is automatically "completed" upon the end of the cruise.
